 ## Project Title
 ### Completion rate between 4-year private and public universities across the state of Minnesota

## Project Description
At the start of our project, we began by comparing the undergraduate graduation (completion) rate of Private and Public colleges and universities St. Paul, Minnesota.  During the data cleaning process,  we found the data set started with 11 schools.  Initially we had 16 schools in our data pool of schools in St. Paul, Minnesota.

We called all of the variables and put them in a school summary data frame.
We excluded the 2-year schools, excluded the Luther Seminary and William Mitchell School of Law
Bringing the data to a total of 8 schools:
1.    Bethel University
2.    Concordia University – St. Paul
3.    Hamline University
4.    Macalester University
5.    Metropolitan State University
6.    University of Northwestern-St. Paul
7.    University of St. Thomas
8.    St. Catherine University

Then we re-ran all of the data to include both Minneapolis and Saint Paul as we weren’t getting a large enough public university pool.  In order to do a better analysis on the date, the data pool was still not big enough.  

We pivoted the project and pull 4-year private and public universities across the state of Minnesota.   The data was then run through a worldwide city to get us a total of 19 4-year private and public universities from across the state of Minnesota. 

Our project data now includes:
1. Bemidji State University
2. University of Minnesota-Crookston
3. University of Minnesota-Duluth
4. The College of Saint Scholastica
5. Minnesota State University-Mankato
6. Augsburg University
7. Minneapolis College of Art and Design
8. Concordia College at Moorhead
9. Minnesota State University-Moorhead
10. University of Minnesota-Morris
11. St. Olaf College
12. Saint Cloud State University
13. Hamline University
14. Macalester College
15. University of St. Thomas
16. St. Catherine University
17. Gustavus Adolphus College
18. Winona State University

## Overview insight:
1. Each School Summary
     - Total number of students
     - What is the percentage of graduation rate?
     - Retention Rate
     - Diversity breakdown - graduation rate across different ethnicities
2. Public vs. Private Summary
     - Total number of students
     - What is the percentage of graduation rate?
     - Retention Rate
     - Diversity breakdown - graduation rate across different ethnicities

 ## Research Questions:
 ### Public Vs. Private
1. The correlation between % of ethnicity vs. completion rate
2. The correlation between total students and completion rate
3. The correlation between retention rate(completing at least 1 year) and completion rate
4. Comparing the completion rate between public and private schools

## Breakdown of Tasks
 - Data Cleansing & Analysis : Arnold, Clover, Jacob, Logan and Lori
 - ReadMe File Write-up: Lori
 - Visualization: Logan, Arnold, Jacob
 - Conclusion/professional write-up: Arnold
 - Finalized slide deck: Jacob

 We searched data sets for college stats on graduation rates, drop out rates, acceptance rates, tuition, etc.

 We used Python code in Jupyter Notebooks and Visual Studio Code to scrub the data and run the visualizations using the dependencies of: import json & import requests
