 ## Project Title
 ### Compare graduation rates between 4-year private and public colleges and universities in St. Paul, Minnesota

## Project Description
Comparing the undergraduate graduation rate of Private and Public colleges and universities St. Paul, Minnesota, we found, the data set started with 11 schools.  Initially we had 16 schools in our data pool of schools in St. Paul, Minnesota

We called all of the variables and put them in a school summary data frame.
We excluded the 2-year schools, excluded the Luther Seminary and William Mitchell School of Law
Bringing the data to a total of 8 schools:
1.    Bethel University
2.    Concordia University – St. Paul
3.    Hamline University
4.    Macalester University
5.    Metropolitan State University
6.    University of Northwestern-St. Paul
7.    University of St. Thomas
8.    St. Catherine University

Then we re-ran all of the data to include both Minneapolis and Saint Paul as we weren’t getting a large enough public university pool.
